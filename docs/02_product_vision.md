# Product Vision — 10-Week Progress Tracker

## Vision Statement

Enable learners to complete a 10-week learning journey by making progress visible, easy to log, and motivating to continue.

---

## Problem Statement

Many learners start structured learning programs with strong intent but fail to finish because:

- progress becomes abstract after the first weeks,
- tracking effort feels heavier than the learning itself,
- missed weeks create friction and disengagement instead of recovery.

The problem is not motivation at the start — it is **maintaining momentum over time**.

## Target Users

### Primary User

Learners enrolled in a structured 10-week AI learning path who want a simple, reliable way to track progress and stay oriented week by week.

### User Context

- May be new to building software with AI tools
- Values tangible progress over theoretical planning
- Wants a tool that feels lightweight, not like “another system to manage”

---

## Value Proposition

A focused progress tracker that:

- turns a 10-week plan into a living, visible journey,
- reduces friction to logging progress,
- reinforces confidence through completion and continuity.

The product exists to help users _finish what they start_.

---

## Product Boundaries

This product is:

- purpose-built for tracking progress through a defined multi-week journey,
- designed to be used briefly and frequently,
- opinionated toward completion rather than exhaustive tracking.

This product is not:

- a general-purpose productivity system,
- a note-taking or knowledge-management tool,
- a heavy analytics or planning platform.

---

## Definition of Success

The product is successful when:

- users consistently log weekly progress with minimal effort,
- users can immediately tell where they are in the 10-week journey,
- users complete more weeks than they would without the tracker,
- the tracker becomes a trusted companion during the learning path.

---

## Long-Term Intent (Non-Binding)

Over time, the tracker can evolve toward:

- richer reflection,
- guidance and nudges,
- intelligent interpretation of user input.

These directions must never compromise the product’s core simplicity.
