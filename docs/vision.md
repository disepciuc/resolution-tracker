# Product Vision — AI-Powered 10-Week Progress Tracker

## 1. Product Overview

The AI-Powered 10-Week Progress Tracker is a lightweight web application designed to help users **track, complete, and reflect on a structured 10-week learning journey**.

The product prioritizes:

- fast shipping
- visible progress
- psychological momentum

The initial version (MVP) focuses on **manual progress tracking and deployment**, while the architecture and interaction model are intentionally designed to support **future AI-driven insights, natural language input, and goal reuse**.

This product is both:

- a **tool** (to track progress)
- a **confidence engine** (to reinforce “I can build and ship with AI”).

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Many learners fail to complete multi-week learning paths not because of lack of interest, but because:

- progress is abstract and invisible
- tools are fragmented or over-engineered early
- systems demand effort exactly when motivation drops

Users need a **single, simple, live system** that:

- makes progress tangible
- reduces friction to zero
- evolves with them over time

---

## 3. Target User

**Primary User**

- An AI learner following a structured 10-week program
- May not identify as a “coder”
- Wants to build something real quickly
- Values momentum over perfection

**User Mindset (Week 1)**

> “I want proof that I can build and ship something functional with AI.”

## 4. Product Goals

### MVP Goals (Week 1)

- Enable users to **track completion of all 10 weeks**
- Provide **visual progress feedback**
- Be **live and usable within hours**
- Encourage immediate usage by logging Week 1

### Long-Term Goals (Beyond MVP)

- Support **natural language progress updates**
- Enable **AI-generated insights and reflections**
- Allow reuse for **other goals or learning paths**
- Introduce automation and intelligence incrementally

---

## 5. MVP Scope (Source: 10-Week PDF Snapshot)

### Core Features

- List of all 10 weeks (Week 1 → Week 10)
- Completion checkbox per week
- Notes field per week
- Overall progress bar (based on completed weeks)
- Persistent state (progress is saved)
- Deployed as a live web app
- Ability to mark Week 1 as “Complete” immediately

### UX Principles

- Minimal UI
- Zero configuration
- No onboarding flows
- One screen, clear affordances
- Designed to be used in under 60 seconds

### Explicit Non-Goals (MVP)

- No authentication (single-user only)
- No automation workflows
- No external tools (Notion, Zapier, etc.)
- No advanced analytics
- No AI dependency for core functionality

---

## 6. Expansion Vector (Source: Individual Week 1 Mission)

The following capabilities are **explicitly out of scope for MVP**, but are **designed for future extension**:

### Planned Extensions

- Natural language progress input
- Sentiment detection on weekly notes
- AI-generated summaries and encouragement
- “Suggested next step” logic
- Time tracking per week
- Multi-goal and multi-user support
- Automation (check-ins, reminders)

### Design Implication

Even in MVP:

- Data should be structured per week
- Notes should be free-form text
- UI should allow replacement of manual input with AI-assisted input later
- Progress logic should be abstracted (not hardcoded)

---

## 7. Key Product Principle

> **Ship something real first.  
> Intelligence comes after trust.**

The product succeeds if:

- the user finishes Week 1
- sees visible progress
- believes they will actually use the tracker again

AI is an _amplifier_, not a prerequisite.

---

## 8. Success Criteria

### MVP Success

- App is deployed and accessible via URL
- User has logged Week 1 as complete
- Progress bar reflects completion accurately
- User reports confidence in continuing the program

### Product Success (Longer Term)

- Users reuse the tracker for other goals
- Users rely on reflections, not just checkboxes
- The system evolves without needing a rewrite

---

## 9. Vision Statement (One Line)

A simple, living progress tracker that starts as a checklist — and grows into an intelligent companion for completing meaningful goals.
