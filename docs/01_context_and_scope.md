# Context & Scope — Week 1 Project (10-Week AI Learning Path)

## 1. Background

This project is part of a 10-week AI learning path.

Week 1 requires building a working web application.  
There are **two official Week 1 descriptions** provided by the course, coming from different artifacts.

This document reconciles those descriptions and establishes a single, agreed interpretation that will be used as the foundation for all downstream documents (Vision, PRD, Backlog).

## 2. Source Artifacts

### Source A — Individual Week 1 Page (Text-Based Mission)

Describes:

- Building a “personal resolution tracker using AI”
- Logging progress using natural language
- Receiving intelligent feedback
- Concepts such as categorization, prioritization, sentiment analysis
- Mentions tools like ChatGPT/Claude, Notion AI, Zapier

**Nature of this source:**  
Conceptual, directional, future-facing.  
Focuses on _what the system could become_ as an AI-powered tracker.

---

### Source B — 10-Week Overview PDF (Image Snapshot)

Describes:

- “The Vibe Code Kickoff”
- Deliverable: a working web app that tracks progress across 10 weekends
- Explicit feature requirements grouped as:
  - Core
  - Advanced
- Explicit “Done when” condition:
  - App is live
  - Week 1 is logged
  - User trusts they will use it

**Nature of this source:**  
Concrete, execution-focused, delivery-oriented.  
Defines _what must be built now_.

## 3. Observed Differences

| Aspect        | Source A (Text)             | Source B (Image)          |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Focus         | AI interaction & automation | Shipping a usable web app |
| Scope clarity | Broad / aspirational        | Explicit and concrete     |
| Tooling       | External tools mentioned    | Self-contained web app    |
| Time horizon  | Evolves over time           | Week 1 deliverable        |

---

## 4. Unified Interpretation (Agreed Context)

- Week 1’s **primary obligation** is to deliver a **working, deployed web application**.
- The **image snapshot (Source B)** defines the **functional scope** for Week 1.
- The **text-based mission (Source A)** defines the **direction of evolution**, not a requirement to be fully implemented in Week 1.
- All features explicitly listed in the image snapshot — including those labeled “Advanced” — are **in scope for the Week 1 MVP**.

---

## 5. Week 1 MVP Scope (Context Lock)

For Week 1, the product is:

- A web app
- That tracks progress across all 10 weeks
- With:
  - per-week completion
  - notes
  - progress visualization
  - user authentication
  - PWA/mobile access
  - “suggest next weekend” guidance
  - time tracking
- Deployed live
- Used immediately to log Week 1

---

## 6. Explicit Non-Goals for This Phase

- No requirement to integrate external tools (Notion, Zapier, etc.)
- No requirement to implement AI-driven feedback or sentiment analysis in Week 1
- No requirement to generalize beyond the 10-week program yet

These are **not rejected ideas**, only **out of scope for Week 1 delivery**.

---

## 7. Constraint

This document is considered **authoritative context**.

Once approved:

- It should not change unless the course requirements change.
- All downstream documents must align with it.
